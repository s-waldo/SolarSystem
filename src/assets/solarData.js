      "The Sun, a massive star at the solar system's center, is a sphere of hot, ionized gas. Its core generates immense energy through nuclear fusion, radiating light and heat that sustain life on Earth. The Sun's gravitational force dictates the orbits of all planets and other celestial bodies within the solar system. The solar activity, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections, influences space weather and can impact Earth.",

    summary: "Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, is a small, rocky world with a heavily cratered surface, resembling Earth's Moon. Due to its proximity to the Sun and lack of a substantial atmosphere, Mercury experiences extreme temperature variations,1 from scorching days to freezing nights. This planet has a very thin exosphere, and it orbits the sun very quickly.",

    summary: "Venus, often referred to as Earth's \"sister planet\" due to its similar size, is shrouded in a dense atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide. This atmosphere traps heat, creating a runaway greenhouse effect that makes Venus the hottest planet in our solar system. Uniquely, Venus rotates in the opposite direction of most other planets, and it has many volcanos and mountainous regions.",

Its diverse surface features oceans, continents, and a life-sustaining atmosphere rich in nitrogen and oxygen. Earth's dynamic geological activity, including plate tectonics, contributes to its ever-changing landscape. Earth has one large natural satelite, the moon.",

It has a thin atmosphere, and evidence suggests that liquid water once flowed on its surface, raising the possibility of past or present microbial life. Mars has polar ice caps, and large volcanos, and canyons. Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.",
